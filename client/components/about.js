      <h3>ABOUT THE POWER SLEEP APP</h3>
      <p>
        {' '}
        Thank you for visiting our website! Power Sleep is an app created by 3
        friends that just graduated from a full stack software engineering
        bootcamp and who decided to participate in their first hackathon
        together to fine tune their skills. You can find more about us, as well
        as our LinkedIn contact, at the footer of this website.

        {' '}
        When Kali heard about the NASA sponsored Space Apps challenge, she
        immediately let the other bootcamp graduates know. Despite the short
        notice, Lu and Cecilia were very interested in creating an app that
        could, in any way, shape the future of space exploration, so they all
        signed up for the challenge and started coming up with a simple yet
        powerful tool in under 40 hours.

        Power Sleep is a tool that helps astronauts easily schedule their time
        around their vital tasks so that they can keep a good circadian sleep
        cycle.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        {' '}
        The app has been kept very simple and straightforward, to not
        overcomplicate the already busy and stresful lifes of astronauts.
      </p>
      <p>
        {' '}
        Our clean UI helps maintain a calm and relaxing environment, although we
        have plans of adding themes so that each astronaut can personalize their
        dashboard to their preference.
      </p>
      <p>
        {' '}
        Power Sleep integrates with Google calendar for simplicity and to remain
        cross-platform & cross-devices.{' '}
