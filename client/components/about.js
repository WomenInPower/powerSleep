        Thank you for visiting our website!

        <br />
        Power Sleep is an app created by three
        friends that just graduated from a full stack software engineering
        bootcamp. We decided to participate in our first hackathon
        together to fine tune our skills as programmers.

        When Kali heard about the NASA Space Apps challenge, she
        immediately let the other bootcamp graduates know. Despite the short
        notice, Lu and Cecilia were very interested in creating an app that
        could, in any way, shape the future of space exploration.
        <br />
        <br />
        We signed up for the challenge and came up with a simple yet powerful tool in under 40 hours.

        Power Sleep is a web app that helps astronauts easily schedule their time
        around their vital tasks so that they can keep a good circadian sleep
        cycle.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        {' '}
        The app has been kept very simple and straightforward, to not
        overcomplicate the already busy and stressful lives of astronauts.

        Our clean UI helps maintain a calm and relaxing environment.

        Power Sleep integrates with Google Calendar for simplicity and to remain
        cross-platform and device agnostic.{' '}
